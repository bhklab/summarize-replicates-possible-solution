The program allows the user to specify a cellline and drug from their chosen dataset, then plots the dose response curve by summarizing the replicate experiments (averaging the viabilities at each common dose). The pattern object may need to be changed depending on the dataset being used. Some datasets start their replicate experiment ids with cellline_drug_ , others start with drug_cellline_ , and some start with something else entirely. Once that is determined, the pattern object can be changed easily in the code.
